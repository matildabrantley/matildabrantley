### About Me
I'm Matilda Brantley, a full stack web developer. I love seeing an idea in my mind spring to life. 
Designing software is the perfect outlet for this as it's one of the most living, mutable designs we make. 
I also have a passion for the biological sciences, especially intelligent systems and evolution. These inspire my 
ideals for software that can adjust to ever-changing needs and generate satisfying novel experiences for the user.  
  
I recently completed Georgia Tech's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp and graduated with a Bachelor of Science
from Rogers State University and Evergreen State College. Frameworks and technologies I'm currently involved with
include React, MongoDB, Progressive Web Apps, Express/Node, Phaser and AI.  
My coding experience goes back over a decade as an enthusiastic hobbyist, coming from a family of coders and engineers. 
  
I started with C++ and Java in the late 2000s, writing simple neural nets. In university, I received 
a well-rounded CS education of both theory and application, discovering new paradigms and learning Haskell, C, C#, Python and JavaScript. 
I enjoyed working with JS so much I decided to specialize in full stack web development: designing apps for the web uniquely bridges
that divide between user and developer in ways both succinct and satisfying.
